### Access to Drinking Water

### Project Overview
This project investigates access to safe and affordable drinking water using the JMP dataset from the World Health Organisation. We will utilise Google Sheets to clean, analyse, and visualise the data, aligning our findings with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6**: **Clean Water and Sanitation**.

The aims of the project are to:
1. Compare the estimated population with the dataset population.
2. Gain insights into the distribution of water access categories (basic, limited, and unimproved) across different regions.
3. Examine the access to water at varying service levels with population sizes.
4. Identify any relationships between income groups and national water access.

### Steps for the Project
1. The first step involves understanding the JMP dataset by analysing the data, identifying the data types in each column, and clarifying the meanings of the column headers. ![screenshot 1 0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45aa0fe2-42ce-4d36-a800-8608883e5f02)

2. The next step includes importing the dataset into Google Sheets and cleaning the data by identifying and correcting blank values and incorrectly imported cells. The dataset uses both commas and semicolons as delimiters. To address this, use the "Find" function to locate semicolon delimiters and the "COUNTBLANK" function to find empty cells. ![1 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ce601ac-b2b0-4a0b-949a-e21d23505706)  ![screenshot 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eebbcbd1-0a5a-4563-83a4-34106ea0e5ab)


3. Finally, we will visualise the data using various functions and manipulations through Google Sheets to draw conclusions and discover insights.
