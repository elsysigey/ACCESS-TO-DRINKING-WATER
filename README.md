## ALX DATA ANALYTICS PROJECT 

## Project Overview
This collection of projects is part of the ALX Data Analytics Program. It demonstrates my ability to work with **Google Sheets**, **SQL**, and **Power BI** to manage, analyse, and visualise data.
The primary goal of the project is to showcase data cleaning, transformation, querying, and reporting skills across different industry-relevant tools.

## Main Tools Used
- **Google Sheets**:  
  - Data entry
  - Basic to intermediate data cleaning
  - Data organisation and preliminary exploration (e.g., formulas, pivot tables, conditional formatting)
  
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**:  
  - Data extraction from relational databases
  - Data cleaning and manipulation (e.g., filtering, joining, aggregation)
  - Writing complex queries to generate meaningful insights

- **Power BI**:  
  - Data visualisation
  - Creation of interactive dashboards
  - Data storytelling and reporting to summarise findings and recommend actions

## Project Scope
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing inconsistencies, duplicates, and errors in raw datasets using Google Sheets and SQL.
- **Data Transformation**: Structuring the data to make it analysis-ready using SQL queries and pivot tables.
- **Data Analysis**: Performing descriptive analysis to identify patterns, trends, and key metrics.
- **Data Visualisation**: Building dynamic dashboards in Power BI to communicate insights effectively.
- **Reporting**: Professionally summarising findings to support decision-making.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Spreadsheet data handling and functions (VLOOKUP, IF statements, pivot tables)
- SQL querying (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, CTES, Subqueries)
- Building professional-level dashboards in Power BI
- Analytical thinking and problem-solving

## How to Navigate This Project
- **Datasets**: Stored and cleaned first in Google Sheets.
- **SQL Queries**: Used to run operations on a relational database based on cleaned datasets.
- **Power BI Report**: Final visual presentation and storytelling based on SQL outputs.

## Conclusion
This project strengthens practical knowledge in data analytics by simulating real-world data management, analysis, and reporting tasks. The skills learned here form a solid foundation for advanced data analytics work and decision support roles.
